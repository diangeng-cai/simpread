> It was proved that annealing at 300 and 450 °C destabilizes the lamellar microstructure, promoting the formation of carbon-deficient (Fe,Mn,Cr)3C-type cementite particles with preferentially rounded and partially faceted hetero-interfaces. Annealing at 450 °C yielded the accumulation of Mn and Cr at the ferrite/particle interfaces, and their concentrations at the interfaces were dependent on the interface structure; i.e., lower concentrations at rounded interfaces (formed through capillarity–driven coarsening of the spheroidized cementite), and higher concentrations at faceted interfaces (that are initially existing in the as-drawn state).
